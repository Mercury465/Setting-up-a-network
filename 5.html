  <p>Open the router's configuration page. If your router did not come with any installation software, you will need to connect to the router's configuration page through your web browser. Open your browser of choice and enter the web address for the router. This is typically 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1. Consult the documentation that came with the router to find the exact address.</p>
