  <p>Connect a computer via Ethernet cable. This step is not always necessary, but can be very useful if you want to set up the wireless router before connecting any wireless devices to it. Connecting a computer through a physical cable will allow you to tinker with the wireless settings without losing your connection to the router.</p>
